Consider the following dictionary:

human = {
    "role": "Child",
    "name": "Daniel Craig",
    "age": 16,
    "parents": [
        {
            "role": "Father",
            "name": "John Craig",
            "age": 48,
            "job": "Programmer"
        },
        {
            "role": "Mother",
            "name": "Sarah Craig",
            "age": 45,
            "job": "Data analyst"
        }
    ]
}

Perfrom the following operations:

1. By accessing the data from the disctonary, print out the sentence:

    My name is Daniel Craig and my parents are John Craig and Sarah Craig

2. Using an if condition, if the age of the child is above 18, print out that he is an adult. Else, print out that he is not an adult

3. By accessing the ages of the father and mother from the dictionary, perform the following calculation: 

    - Print out the addition of the ages
    - Print out the subtraction of the ages
    - If the age difference is greater than 5 years, print out: "Age difference is 5 years"
